You will start the game with 0 points (remember that your goal is to reach 1000 points to complete and win the game).

In this wet and final level, we've given a little nod to the Super Mario aqua screens.

Our ninja becomes an expert diver through the icy waters of the Pacific while dodging hungry sharks.

**Be careful with them!** They will take your life away, while the disfrutones dwarves will continue to fall from the sky.

**Keep picking fruit underwater and you can achieve victory!**


```
Little reminder:

In this final level, you can use the upper arrow to keep the ninja above the barrier reef. 

Sometimes sharks hide down there.

```
